# Unclear Error from Expo DocumentPicker on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  The issue is inconsistent error handling from the promise returned by `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()`.  Sometimes it rejects with a non-specific error message, making debugging and resolving the problem difficult.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the app on an Android device or emulator.
2. Tap the "Pick a file" button.
3. Select a file from your device's file explorer.
4. Observe the result; sometimes a file path will be returned as expected, other times a vague error will be displayed.

## Expected Behavior

A clear and informative error message should be provided when `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()` fails, indicating the specific cause of the problem.  Currently, the error messages provide insufficient information for effective debugging.

## Actual Behavior

A generic error, such as "Error: An error occurred." or similar, is returned, providing little insight into the underlying issue.

## Solution

The provided solution introduces better error handling to provide more informative feedback to the user. While the root cause of the underlying issue is still unclear, this improved feedback helps significantly in debugging and troubleshooting scenarios.
